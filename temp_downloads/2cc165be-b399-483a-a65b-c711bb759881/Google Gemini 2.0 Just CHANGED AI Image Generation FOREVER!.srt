1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,159
[speaker_0] So I want you to imagine for a moment that

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,319
[speaker_0] you are a catalog manager, for example, for an e-commerce

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,539
[speaker_0] company, and maybe you have a singular image of a

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,719
[speaker_0] model wearing a piece of clothing. But you don't have

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,539
[speaker_0] other angles of that image and you wanna use AI

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,079
[speaker_0] to generate those images. Well, check this out. As you

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,279
[speaker_0] can see, I wanna create a side view of this

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,959
[speaker_0] original photo that I have. Boom, I have a side

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,539
[speaker_0] view shot of that piece of clothing. Next, how about

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,979
[speaker_0] create a rear view of this photo? Boom, rear view

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
[speaker_0] of photo. Piece of cake. Check it out. This is

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,680
[speaker_1] Rossy Bytes. So what I wanna talk about today is

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,559
[speaker_0] in the Google AI Studio, the Gemini 2 Flash experimental

14
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,379
[speaker_0] model. So when you come into the AI Studio, and

15
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:53,119
[speaker_0] I'll include the link in the description below, you're gonna

16
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
[speaker_0] wanna come underneath Preview and select Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,219
[speaker_0] And then for output format, you wanna select images and

18
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,619
[speaker_0] text. So let's try out a few different examples of

19
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,719
[speaker_0] things that we can do with this. So to start,

20
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,159
[speaker_0] I'm gonna bring over an image that I already have

21
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:10,799
[speaker_0] of a model wearing a dress, and I'm gonna say

22
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,419
[speaker_0] create a side view of this photo. We'll just click

23
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:19,039
[speaker_0] Run. You can see how long it's taking for the

24
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:23,239
[speaker_0] Gemini to actually process this. So 4.8 seconds and it

25
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:28,959
[speaker_0] generated a pretty perfect side view of that particular clothing.

26
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,339
[speaker_0] So now let's do create a rear view of the

27
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:46,139
[speaker_0] same image. Go ahead and click Run. Again, five seconds

28
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:49,219
[speaker_0] or so, and we have a perfect rear image. If

29
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,139
[speaker_0] we open it up, it looks like the same model,

30
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,319
[speaker_0] same clothing. Okay, so next I'm gonna drag over a

31
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,859
[speaker_0] male model wearing a suit and I'm going to do

32
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,559
[speaker_0] the same test. I'm going to say create a side

33
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:09,539
[speaker_0] view of this photo, and we'll click Run. This one's

34
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,799
[speaker_0] taking a little longer, but boom, look at that. We

35
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,439
[speaker_0] have a side view shot of that guy wearing the

36
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:19,239
[speaker_0] suit. So just like we did with the model, I'll

37
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,599
[speaker_0] also come in and say create a rear view of

38
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:31,479
[speaker_0] the same photo and click Run. And there we have

39
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,679
[speaker_0] a rear view of the model wearing that suit. Okay,

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,019
[speaker_0] next I have this image of people playing in a

41
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,059
[speaker_0] yard on a patio at a house, and what I

42
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,799
[speaker_0] wanna do is I want to use this image and

43
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,939
[speaker_0] I want to try to remove the people out of

44
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,819
[speaker_0] the background. So I'm gonna say remove the people from

45
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:59,819
[speaker_0] this photo, and click Run. And within about nine seconds,

46
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,079
[speaker_0] take a look at that. All the people are gone

47
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,619
[speaker_0] from the photo. Generate a recipe with steps and images

48
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,719
[speaker_0] with each step of the way on how to make

49
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:16,199
[speaker_0] French toast. As we can see, we have ingredients and

50
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,979
[speaker_0] equipment. Crack the large eggs, add the milk, whisk the

51
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:31,739
[speaker_0] ingredients thoroughly, soak the bread. It's showing you the skillet

52
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,739
[speaker_0] with butter, cooking the French toast. That is insane. Then

53
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:40,439
[speaker_0] flipping it over. Repeat and add more butter. There you

54
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,959
[speaker_0] have your finished French toast, and then you can add

55
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,859
[speaker_0] some toppings. For this one I wanna say generate an

56
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:59,419
[speaker_0] intricate mandala coloring page in black and white. So kind

57
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,399
[speaker_0] of like just a coloring page in a coloring book.

58
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,759
[speaker_0] So that took about 15 seconds, but as you can

59
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,999
[speaker_0] see, we have a very intricate mandala drawing picture. So

60
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:18,239
[speaker_0] now I'm going to say now color this image in

61
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:27,639
[speaker_0] with vibrant and beautiful colors. Click Run. So that took

62
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,499
[speaker_0] about 20 seconds, but as we can see, we have

63
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:35,459
[speaker_0] a colored-in version of our mandala coloring page. So next

64
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,999
[speaker_0] I wanna see how Gemini does creating an image. So

65
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,819
[speaker_0] I'm basically asking with a very detailed prompt to create

66
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:45,099
[speaker_0] a black and white photograph of an elderly couple walking

67
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,759
[speaker_0] hand in hand in a park, and as you can

68
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,779
[speaker_0] see, it created a fantastic-looking image. So now I wanna

69
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,939
[speaker_0] have it color this picture in, so I'm gonna say

70
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:02,559
[speaker_0] colorize this image now. And within 5.2 seconds, look at

71
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,879
[speaker_0] that. We have a full-color version of the same photo.

72
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,939
[speaker_0] Next I'm gonna say add a small dog somewhere on

73
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,019
[speaker_0] the sidewalk. And look at that. Not only is it

74
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,919
[speaker_0] on the sidewalk, but the couple's actually walking it. Okay,

75
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,019
[speaker_0] so next I have an image of a sofa and

76
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,239
[speaker_0] I wanna try to change the color of the sofa

77
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,659
[speaker_0] so we could maybe have multiple variations of it. So

78
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,739
[speaker_0] I'm gonna say make this sofa blue colored, and then

79
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,439
[speaker_0] I'm gonna click Run. In about five seconds, look at

80
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:44,939
[speaker_0] that. We have a blue version of our sofa. So

81
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:54,459
[speaker_0] next I'm gonna say now make it burnt orange. And

82
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:59,199
[speaker_0] there's a burnt orange version of our sofa. I'm going

83
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:04,599
[speaker_0] to now say add a stylistic clock on the wall

84
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:12,099
[speaker_0] in the background. That's crazy. So now we have our

85
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,279
[speaker_0] stylistic clock on the wall in the background. So as

86
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,879
[speaker_0] you can see, this technology is absolutely amazing, and the

87
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,879
[speaker_0] really crazy thing about it is what I've shown you

88
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,379
[speaker_0] here is the worst it'll ever be. It's only going

89
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,779
[speaker_0] to get exponentially better. Let me know what you think

90
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,539
[speaker_0] of this in the comments, and if you'd like me
